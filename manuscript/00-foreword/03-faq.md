## FAQ

**How to get updates?** I have two channels where I share updates about my content. Either you can [subscribe to updates by email](https://www.getrevue.co/profile/rwieruch) or [follow me on Twitter](https://twitter.com/rwieruch). Regardless of the channel, my objective is to only share qualitative content. You will never receive any spam. Once you get the update that the book has changed, you can download the new version of it.

**Does it use the recent React version?** The book always receives an update when the React version got updated. Usually books are outdated pretty soon after their release. Since this book is self-published, I can update it whenever I want.

**How to get access to the source code projects and screencasts series?** If you have bought one of the extended packages that gives you access to the source code projects, screencast series or any other addon, you should find these on your [course dashboard](https://roadtoreact.com/my-courses). If you have bought the course somewhere else than on [the official Road to React](https://roadtoreact.com) course platform, you need to create an account on the platform, go to the Admin page and reach out to me with one of the email templates. Afterward I can enroll you to the course. If you haven't bought one of the extended packages, you can reach out any time to upgrade your content to access the source code projects and screencast series.

**How can I get help while reading the book?** The book has a [Slack Group](https://slack-the-road-to-learn-react.wieruch.com/) for people who are reading the book. You can join the channel to get help or to help others. After all, helping others can internalize your learnings, too. If there is no one out to help you, you can always reach out to me.

**Is there any troubleshoot area?** If you run into problems, please join the Slack Group. In addition, you could have a look into the [open issues on GitHub](https://github.com/rwieruch/taming-the-state-in-react/issues) for the book. Perhaps your problem was already mentioned and you can find the solution for it. If your problem wasn't mentioned, don't hesitate to open a new issue where you can explain your problem, maybe provide a screenshot, and some more details (e.g. book page, node version). After all, I try to ship all fixes in next editions of the book.

**What should I do when I cannot afford to pay for the book?** If you cannot afford the book but want to learn about the topic, you can reach out to me. It could be that you are still a student or that the book would be too expensive in your country. In addition, I want to support any cause to improve the diversity in our culture of developers. If you belong to a minority or are in an organization that supports diversity, please reach out to me.

**Can I help to improve the content?** Yes, I would love to hear your feedback. You can simply open an issue on [GitHub](https://github.com/rwieruch/taming-the-state-in-react). These can be improvements technical wise yet also about the written word. I am no native speaker that's why any help is appreciated. You can open pull requests on the GitHub page as well.

**How to support the project?** If you believe in the content that I create, you can [support me](https://www.robinwieruch.de/about/). Furthermore, I would be grateful if you spread the word about this book after you read it and enjoyed reading it. Furthermore, I would love to have you as my [Patron on Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/rwieruch).

**Is there a money back guarantee?** Yes, there is 100% money back guarantee for two months if you don't think it's a good fit. Please reach out to me to get a refund.

**Why does it use React to teach about state?** Nowadays, state management is often used in modern applications. These applications are built with solutions like React, Angular and Vue. In order to teach about state management, it makes sense to apply it in a real world context such as React. I picked React, because it has only a slim API and a good learning curve. It is only the view layer with local state management. You can learn about it in one of my other books: [the Road to learn React](https://www.robinwieruch.de/the-road-to-learn-react/). However, you don't necessarily need to apply your learnings about state management in React. You can apply these learnings in your Angular, Vue or React Native application, too.

**What is the ratio between learning Redux and MobX?** Even though MobX becomes more of a popular alternative to Redux, the book teaches you more about Redux than MobX. However, in the future I want to extend the content and depending on the popularities adjust the chapters.

**What's your motivation behind the book?** I want to teach about this topic in a consistent way. You often find material online that doesn't receive any updates or only teaches a small part of a topic. When you learn something new, people struggle to find consistent and up-to-date resources to learn from. I want to give you this consistent and up-to-date learning experience. In addition, I hope I can support minorities with my projects by giving them the content for free or by [having other impacts](https://www.robinwieruch.de/giving-back-by-learning-react/). In addition, in the recent time, I found myself fulfilled when teaching others about programming. It's a meaningful activity for me that I prefer over any other 9 to 5 job at any company. That's why I hope to pursue this path in the future.

**Is there a call to action?** Yes. I want you to take a moment to think about a person who would be a good match to learn Redux. The person could have shown the interest already, could be in the middle of learning Redux or might not yet be aware about wanting to learn Redux. Reach out to that person and share the book. It would mean a lot to me. The book is intended to be given to others.
