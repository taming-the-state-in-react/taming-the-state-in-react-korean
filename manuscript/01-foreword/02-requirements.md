## 1.2 준비사항

What are the requirements to read the book? First of all, you should be familiar with the basics of web development. You should know how to use HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Perhaps it makes sense to know the term [API](https://www.robinwieruch.de/what-is-an-api-javascript/) too, because you will use APIs in the book. In addition, I encourage you to join the official [Slack Group](https://slack-the-road-to-learn-react.wieruch.com/) for the book to get help or to help others.

### 0.2.1 리액트

The book uses React as library to teach modern state management. It is a perfect choice for demonstrating and learning state management in modern applications. Because React is only a view layer, it is up to you to decide how to deal with the state in your application. The state management layer is exchangeable.

After all, it's not necessary to be a React developer in order to learn about state management in modern applications. If you are developing with another SPA framework, such as Angular, or view layer library, such as Vue, all these things about state management taught in this book can still be applied in your applications. The state management solutions are agnostic to frameworks and libraries.

Still, since the book uses React for the sake of teaching state management in a proper context, if you are not familiar with React or need to have a refresher on the topic, I encourage you to read the precedent book: [The Road to learn React](https://www.robinwieruch.de/the-road-to-learn-react/). It is for free and should enable everyone to learn React. However, you can decide to pay something to support the project.

Even though the book is for free, people with lacking education have no access to these resources in the first place. They have to be educated in the English language to be enabled to access it. The Road to learn React attempts [to support education in the developing world](https://www.robinwieruch.de/giving-back-by-learning-react/) on an occasionally basis, but it is a tough undertaking since the book itself is pay what you want.

In addition, the Road to learn React teaches you to make the transition from JavaScript ES5 to JavaScript ES6. After having read the Road to learn React, you should possess all the knowledge to read this book. It builds up on the React book perfectly.

### Editor and Terminal

What about the development environment? You will need a running editor or IDE and terminal (command line tool). You can [follow my setup guide](https://www.robinwieruch.de/developer-setup/). It is adjusted for MacOS users, but you can find a Windows setup guide for React too. In general, there is a ton of articles out there that will show you how to setup a web development environment in a more elaborated way for your OS.

Optionally, you can use git and GitHub on your own, while conducting the exercises in the book, to keep your projects and the progress in repositories on GitHub. There exists a [little guide](https://www.robinwieruch.de/git-essential-commands/) on how to use these tools. But once again, it is not mandatory for the book and can be overwhelming when learning everything from scratch. So you can skip it if you are a newcomer in web development to focus on the essential parts taught in this book.

### Node and NPM

Last but not least, you will need an installation of [node and npm](https://nodejs.org/en/). Both are used to manage libraries you will need along the way. In this book, you will install external node packages via npm (node package manager). These node packages can be libraries or whole frameworks.

You can verify your versions of node and npm on the command line. If you don't get any output in the terminal, you need to install node and npm first. These are only my versions during the time writing this book:

{title="Command Line",lang="text"}
~~~~~~~~
node --version
*v8.2.1
npm --version
*v5.3.0
~~~~~~~~

If you read the Road to learn React, you should be familiar with the setup already. The book gives you a short introduction into the npm ecosystem on the command line, too. So if you are not familiar with this, once again you can pick up the Road to learn React book.
