## Scaling Local State in React

You should know about all the basics in React's local state management by now. However, you will notice that there are more patterns and best practices out there to apply local state in a scaling application. The following chapter gives you insights into these topics.

### Lifting State

In a scaling application, you will notice that you pass a lot of state down to child components as props. These props are often passed down multiple component levels. That's how state is shared vertically in your application. Yet, the other way around, you will notice that more components need to use and thus share the same state. That's how state needs to be shared horizontally across components in your component tree. These two scaling issues, sharing state vertically and horizontally, are common in local state management. Therefore you can lift the state up and down for keeping your local state architecture maintainable. Lifting the state prevents sharing too much or too little state in your component tree. Basically, it is a refactoring that you have to do once in a while to keep your components maintainable and focused on only consuming the state that they need to consume.

In order to experience up and down lifting of local state, the following chapter will demonstrate it with two examples. The first example that demonstrates the uplifting of state is called: "Search a List"-example. The second example that demonstrates the downlifting of state is called "Archive in a List"-example.

The "Search a List"-example has three components. Two sibling components, a `Search` component and a `List` component, that are used in an overarching `SearchableList` component. First, the implementation of the `Search` component:

{title="Code Playground",lang="javascript"}
~~~~~~~~
import React from 'react';

class Search extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);

    this.state = {
      query: ''
    };

    this.onChange = this.onChange.bind(this);
  }

  onChange(event) {
    const { value } = event.target;

    this.setState({
      query: value
    });
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        {this.props.children} <input
          type="text"
          value={this.state.query}
          onChange={this.onChange}
        />
      </div>
    );
  }
}
~~~~~~~~

Second, the implementation of `List` component:

{title="Code Playground",lang="javascript"}
~~~~~~~~
function List({ list }) {
  return (
    <ul>
      {list.map(item => <li key={item.id}>{item.name}</li>)}
    </ul>
  );
}
~~~~~~~~

Third, the `SearchableList` component which uses both components, the `Search` and `List` components, and thus both components become siblings in the component tree:

{title="Code Playground",lang="javascript"}
~~~~~~~~
function SearchableList({ list }) {
  return (
    <div>
      <Search>Search List:</Search>
      <List list={list} />
    </div>
  );
}
~~~~~~~~

While the `Search` component is a stateful ES6 class component, the `List` component is only a stateless functional component. The parent component that combines the `List` and `Search` components into a `SearchableList` component is a stateless functional component too.

However, the example doesn't work. The `Search` component knows about the `query` that could be used to filter the list, but the `List` component doesn't know about it. The state from the `Search` component can only flow down the component tree by using props but not up. Therefore, you have to lift the state of the `Search` component up to the `SearchableList` to make the `query` state accessible for the `List` component in order to filter the list eventually. You want to share the `query` state in both `List` component and `Search` component. Whereas the `Search` component is responsible for altering the state, the `List` component consumes the state to filter the list of items. The state should be managed in the `SearchableList` component to make it readable and writeable for both sibling components below.

In order to lift the state up, the `SearchableList` becomes a stateful component. You have to refactor it to a React ES6 class component. On the other hand, you can refactor the `Search` component to a functional stateless component, because it doesn't need to be stateful anymore. The stateful parent component takes care about its whole state. In other cases, the `Search` component might stay as a stateful ES6 class component, because it still manages some other state, but it is not the case in this example. So first, that's the adjusted `Search` component:

{title="Code Playground",lang="javascript"}
~~~~~~~~
# leanpub-start-insert
function Search({ query, onChange, children }) {
# leanpub-end-insert
  return (
    <div>
      {children} <input
        type="text"
# leanpub-start-insert
        value={query}
        onChange={onChange}
# leanpub-end-insert
      />
    </div>
  );
}
~~~~~~~~

Second, the adjusted `SearchableList` component:

{title="Code Playground",lang="javascript"}
~~~~~~~~
import React from 'react';

class SearchableList extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);

# leanpub-start-insert
    this.state = {
      query: ''
    };

    this.onChange = this.onChange.bind(this);
  }

  onChange(event) {
    const { value } = event.target;

    this.setState({
      query: value
    });
  }
# leanpub-end-insert

  render() {
    const { list } = this.props;
# leanpub-start-insert
    const { query } = this.state;
# leanpub-end-insert

    return (
      <div>
        <Search
# leanpub-start-insert
          query={query}
          onChange={this.onChange}
# leanpub-end-insert
        >
          Search List:
        </Search>
# leanpub-start-insert
        <List list={(list || []).filter(byQuery(query))} />
# leanpub-end-insert
      </div>
    );
  }
}

# leanpub-start-insert
function byQuery(query) {
  return function(item) {
    return !query ||
      item.name.toLowerCase().includes(query.toLowerCase());
  }
}
# leanpub-end-insert
~~~~~~~~

After you have lifted the state up, the parent component takes care about the local state management. Both child components don't need to take care about it. You have lifted the state up to share the local state across the child components. The list gets filtered by the search query before it reaches the `List` component. An alternative would be passing the `query` state as prop to the `List` component and the `List` component would apply the filter to the list.

In the next part, let's get to the second example: the "Archive in a List"-example. It builds up on the previous example, but this time the `List` component has the extended functionality to archive an item in the list. Therefore, it needs to have a button to archive an item in the list identified by an unique `id` property of the item. First, the enhanced `List` component:

{title="Code Playground",lang="javascript"}
~~~~~~~~
# leanpub-start-insert
function List({ list, onArchive }) {
# leanpub-end-insert
  return (
    <ul>
      {list.map(item =>
        <li key={item.id}>
          <span>
            {item.name}
          </span>
# leanpub-start-insert
          <span>
            <button
              type="button"
              onClick={() => onArchive(item.id)}
            >
              Archive
            </button>
# leanpub-end-insert
          </span>
        </li>
      )}
    </ul>
  );
}
~~~~~~~~

Second, the `SearchableList` component which holds the state of archived items:

{title="Code Playground",lang="javascript"}
~~~~~~~~
import React from 'react';

class SearchableList extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);

    this.state = {
      query: '',
# leanpub-start-insert
      archivedItems: []
# leanpub-end-insert
    };

    this.onChange = this.onChange.bind(this);
# leanpub-start-insert
    this.onArchive = this.onArchive.bind(this);
# leanpub-end-insert
  }

  ...

# leanpub-start-insert
  onArchive(id) {
    const { archivedItems } = this.state;

    this.setState({
      archivedItems: [...archivedItems, id]
    });
  }
# leanpub-end-insert

  render() {
    const { list } = this.props;
# leanpub-start-insert
    const { query, archivedItems } = this.state;

    const filteredList = list
      .filter(byQuery(query))
      .filter(byArchived(archivedItems));
# leanpub-end-insert

    return (
      <div>
        ...
        <List
# leanpub-start-insert
          list={filteredList}
          onArchive={this.onArchive}
# leanpub-end-insert
        />
      </div>
    );
  }
}

...

# leanpub-start-insert
function byArchived(archivedItems) {
  return function(item) {
    return !archivedItems.includes(item.id);
  }
}
# leanpub-end-insert
~~~~~~~~

The `Search` component stays untouched. As you have seen, the previous example was extended to facilitate the archiving of items in a list. Now, the `List` component receives all the necessary properties: an `onArchive()` callback function and the list, filtered by `query` and `archivedItems`. It only shows items filtered by the query from the `Search` component and items which are not archived.

You might see already the flaw. The `SearchableList` takes care about the archiving functionality. However, it doesn't need the functionality itself. It only passes all the state to the `List` component as props. It manages the state on behalf of the `List` component. No other component cares about this state. In a scaling application, it would make sense to lift the state down to the `List` component, because only the `List` component cares about it and no other component has to manage it on the `List` component's behalf. Even though the `List` component becomes a stateful component afterward, it is step in the right direction keeping the local state maintainable in the long run. First, the enhanced stateful `List` component which takes care about the state:

{title="Code Playground",lang="javascript"}
~~~~~~~~
import React from 'react';

# leanpub-start-insert
class List extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);

    this.state = {
      archivedItems: []
    };

    this.onArchive = this.onArchive.bind(this);
  }

  onArchive(id) {
    const { archivedItems } = this.state;

    this.setState({
      archivedItems: [...archivedItems, id]
    });
  }
# leanpub-end-insert

  render() {
    const { list } = this.props;
# leanpub-start-insert
    const { archivedItems } = this.state;

    const filteredList = list
      .filter(byArchived(archivedItems));
# leanpub-end-insert

    return (
      <ul>
# leanpub-start-insert
        {filteredList.map(item =>
# leanpub-end-insert
          <li key={item.id}>
            <span>
              {item.name}
            </span>
            <span>
              <button
                type="button"
# leanpub-start-insert
                onClick={() => this.onArchive(item.id)}
# leanpub-end-insert
              >
                Archive
              </button>
            </span>
          </li>
        )}
      </ul>
    );
  }
}
~~~~~~~~

Second, the `SearchableList` component which only cares about the state from the previous example but not about the archived items anymore:

{title="Code Playground",lang="javascript"}
~~~~~~~~
import React from 'react';

class SearchableList extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);

    this.state = {
      query: ''
    };

    this.onChange = this.onChange.bind(this);
  }

  ...

  render() {
    const { list } = this.props;
# leanpub-start-insert
    const { query } = this.state;

    const filteredList = list
      .filter(byQuery(query));
# leanpub-end-insert

    return (
      <div>
        ...
# leanpub-start-insert
        <List list={filteredList} />
# leanpub-end-insert
      </div>
    );
  }
}
~~~~~~~~

That's how you can lift state down. It is used to keep the state only next to component that care about the state. Let's recap both approaches. In the first example, the "Search a List"-example, the state had to be lifted up to share the `query` property in two child components. The `Search` component had to manipulate the state by using a callback function, but also had to use the `query` to be a controlled component regarding the input field. On the other hand, the `SearchableList` component had to filter the list by using the `query` property on behalf of the `List` component. Another solution would have been to pass down the `query` property to the `List` component and let the component deal with the filtering itself. After all, the state got lifted up the component tree to share it vertically across more components.

In the second example, the "Archive in a List"-example, the state could be lifted down to keep the state maintainable in the long run. The parent component shouldn't be concerned about state that isn't used by the parent component itself and isn't shared across multiple child components. Because only one child component cared about the archived items, it was a good change to lift the state down to the only component which cares about the state. After all, the state got lifted down the component tree.

In conclusion, lifting state allows you to keep your local state management maintainable. **Lifting state should be used to give components access to all the state they need, but not to more state than they need.** Sometimes you have to refactor components from a functional stateless component to a React ES6 class component or vice versa. It's not always possible, because a component that could become possibly a stateless functional component could still have other stateful properties.

### Functional State

In the recent chapters you have used `this.setState()` to alter the local state. However, there is a flaw in using `this.setState()` the way we did in the last chapters for certain use cases: It is important to know that `this.setState()` is executed asynchronously to update the local state. React batches all the state updates, because it executes them after each other for performance optimizations. Thus, the `this.setState()` method comes in two versions.

In its first version, the `this.setState()` method takes an object to update the state. As explained in a previous chapter, the merging of the object is a shallow merge. For instance, when updating `authors` in a state object of `authors` and `articles`, the `articles` stay intact. The previous examples have already used this approach:

{title="Code Playground",lang="javascript"}
~~~~~~~~
this.setState({
  ...
});
~~~~~~~~

In its second version, the `this.setState()` method takes a function as argument. The function has the previous state and props in the function signature to be used for the state update.

{title="Code Playground",lang="javascript"}
~~~~~~~~
this.setState((prevState, props) => ({
  ...
}));
~~~~~~~~

So, what's the flaw in using `this.setState()` with an object? In several examples in the last chapters, the state was updated based on the previous state or props. However, `this.setState()` executes asynchronously. Thus the state or props that are used to perform the update could be stale at this point in time, because the state was updated more than once in between. It could lead to bugs in your local state management, because you would update the state based on stale properties. When using the functional approach to update the local state, the state and props are used when `this.setState()` performs asynchronously at the time of its execution. Let's revisit one of the previous examples:

{title="Code Playground",lang="javascript"}
~~~~~~~~
import React from 'react';

class CounterContainer extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);

    this.state = {
      counter: 0
    };

    this.onIncrement = this.onIncrement.bind(this);
    this.onDecrement = this.onDecrement.bind(this);
  }

  onIncrement() {
    this.setState({
      counter: this.state.counter + 1
    });
  }

  onDecrement() {
    this.setState({
      counter: this.state.counter - 1
    });
  }

  render() {
    return <CounterPresenter
      counter={this.state.counter}
      onIncrement={this.onIncrement}
      onDecrement={this.onDecrement}
    />
  }
}
~~~~~~~~

Executing one of the class methods, `onIncrement()` or `onDecrement()`, multiple times could lead to a bug. Because both methods depend on the previous state, it could use a stale state when the asynchronous update wasn't executed in between and the method got invoked another time.

{title="Code Playground",lang="javascript"}
~~~~~~~~
this.setState({ counter: this.state.counter + 1 }); // this.state: { counter: 0 }
this.setState({ counter: this.state.counter + 1 }); // this.state: { counter: 0 }
this.setState({ counter: this.state.counter + 1 }); // this.state: { counter: 0 }
// updated state: { counter: 1 }
// instead of: { counter: 3 }
~~~~~~~~

It becomes even more error prone when multiple functions, such as `onIncrement()` and `onDecrement()`, that use `this.setState()` depend on the previous state. You can refactor the example to use the functional state updating approach:

{title="Code Playground",lang="javascript"}
~~~~~~~~
import React from 'react';

class CounterContainer extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    ...
  }

# leanpub-start-insert
  onIncrement() {
    this.setState(prevState => ({
      counter: prevState.counter + 1
    }));
  }

  onDecrement() {
    this.setState(prevState => ({
      counter: prevState.counter - 1
    }));
  }
# leanpub-end-insert

  render() {
    ...
  }
}
~~~~~~~~

The functional approach opens up two more benefits. First, the function which is used in `this.setState()` is a pure function. There are no side-effects. The function always will return the same output (next state) when given the same input (previous state). It makes it predictable and uses the benefits of functional programming. Second, since the function is pure, it can be tested easily in an unit test and independently from the component. It gives you the opportunity to test your local state updates as business logic which is separated from the view layer. You only have to extract the function from the component.

{title="Code Playground",lang="javascript"}
~~~~~~~~
import React from 'react';

# leanpub-start-insert
const incrementUpdate = prevState => ({
  counter: prevState.counter + 1
});

const decrementUpdate = prevState => ({
  counter: prevState.counter - 1
});
# leanpub-end-insert

class CounterContainer extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    ...
  }

# leanpub-start-insert
  onIncrement() {
    this.setState(incrementUpdate);
  }

  onDecrement() {
    this.setState(decrementUpdate);
  }
# leanpub-end-insert

  render() {
    ...
  }
}
~~~~~~~~

Now, you could test the pure functions as business logic separately from the view layer. After all you may wonder when to use the object and when to use the function in `this.setState()`? The recommended rules of thumb are:

* Always use `this.setState()` with a function when you depend on previous state or props.
* Only use `this.setState()` with an object when you don't depend on previous properties.
* In case of uncertainty, default to use `this.setState()` with a function.

### Higher-Order Components

Higher-order components (HOCs) can be used for a handful of use cases. One of these use case would be to [enable an elegant way of conditional rendering](https://www.robinwieruch.de/gentle-introduction-higher-order-components/). But this book is about state management, so why not use it to manage the local state of a component? Let's revisit an adjusted example of the "Archive in a List"-example.

{title="Code Playground",lang="javascript"}
~~~~~~~~
import React from 'react';

class ArchiveableList extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);

    this.state = {
      archivedItems: []
    };

    this.onArchive = this.onArchive.bind(this);
  }

  onArchive(id) {
    const { archivedItems } = this.state;

    this.setState({
      archivedItems: [...archivedItems, id]
    });
  }

  render() {
    const { list } = this.props;
    const { archivedItems } = this.state;

    const filteredList = list
      .filter(byArchived(archivedItems));

    return (
      <ul>
        {filteredList.map(item =>
          <li key={item.id}>
            <span>
              {item.name}
            </span>
            <span>
              <button
                type="button"
                onClick={() => onArchive(item.id)}
              >
                Archive
              </button>
            </span>
          </li>
        )}
      </ul>
    );
  }
}

function byArchived(archivedItems) {
  return function(item) {
    return !archivedItems.includes(item.id);
  };
}
~~~~~~~~

The `ArchiveableList` component has two purposes. On the one hand, it is a pure presenter component that shows the items in a list. On the other hand, it is stateful container component that keeps track of the archived items. Therefore, you could split this two responsibilities up into representation and logic thus into presentational and container component. It would be the same refactoring you have done before with the `CounterContainer` and `CounterPresenter` components. However, another approach could be to transfer the logic, in this case the local state management, into a higher-order component. Higher-order components are reusable and thus the local state management could become reusable for many components but not only one.

{title="Code Playground",lang="javascript"}
~~~~~~~~
import React from 'react';

function byArchived(archivedItems) {
  return function(item) {
    return !archivedItems.includes(item.id);
  };
}

function withArchive(Component) {
  class WithArchive extends React.Component {
    constructor(props) {
      super(props);

      this.state = {
        archivedItems: []
      };

      this.onArchive = this.onArchive.bind(this);
    }

    onArchive(id) {
      const { archivedItems } = this.state;

      this.setState({
        archivedItems: [...archivedItems, id]
      });
    }

    render() {
      const { list } = this.props;
      const { archivedItems } = this.state;

      const filteredList = list
        .filter(byArchived(archivedItems));

      return <Component
        list={filteredList}
        onArchive={this.onArchive}
      />
    }
  }

  return WithArchive;
}
~~~~~~~~

In return the `List` component would only display the list and receives a function in its props to archive an item.

{title="Code Playground",lang="javascript"}
~~~~~~~~
function List({ list, onArchive }) {
  return (
    <ul>
      {list.map(item =>
        <li key={item.id}>
          <span>
            {item.name}
          </span>
          <span>
            <button
              type="button"
              onClick={() => onArchive(item.id)}
            >
              Archive
            </button>
          </span>
        </li>
      )}
    </ul>
  );
}
~~~~~~~~

Now you can compose the list facilitating component with the functionality to archive items in a list.

{title="Code Playground",lang="javascript"}
~~~~~~~~
import React from 'react';

function byArchived(archivedItems) { ... }

function withArchive(Component) { ... }

function List({ list, onArchive }) { ... }

const ListWithArchive = withArchive(List);

function App({ list }) {
  return <ListWithArchive list={list} />
}
~~~~~~~~

The `List` component would only display the items. The ability to archive an item in the `List` component would be opt-in with a higher-order component called `withArchive`. In addition, the HOC can be reused in other `List` components too for managing the state of archived items. After all, higher-order components are great to extract local state management from components and to reuse the local state management logic in other components.

### React's Context for Provider and Consumer

The context API is a powerful feature in React. You will not often see it when using plain React, but might consider using it when your React application grows in size and depth from a component perspective. Basically, React's context API takes the clutter away of passing mandatory props, that are needed by every component, down your whole component tree. Most often components in between are not interested in these props.

But you will not only see it when using plain React. Often React's context API can be seen in action when using an external state management library such as Redux or MobX. There, you often end up with a `Provider` component at the top of your component hierarchy that bridges your state layer (Redux/MobX/...) to your view layer (React). The `Provider` component receives the state as props and afterward, each child component has implicitly access to the managed state by Redux and MobX.

Do you remember the last time when you had to pass props several components down your component tree? In plain React, you can be confronted often with this issue which is called "prop drilling". It can happen that a couple of these props are even mandatory for each child component. Thus you would need to pass the props down to each child component. In return, this would clutter every component in between which has to pass down these props without using them oneself.

When these props become mandatory, React's context API gives you a way out of this mess. Instead of passing down the props explicitly down to each component, you can hide props, that are necessary for each component, in React's context and pass them implicitly down to each component. React's context traverses invisible down the component tree. If a component needs access to the context, it can consume it on demand.

What are use cases for this approach? For instance, your application could have a configurable colored theme. Each component should be colored depending on the configuration. The configuration is fetched once from your server, but afterward you want to make this implicitly accessible for all components. Therefore you could use React's context API to give every component access to the colored theme. You would have to provide the colored theme at the top of your component hierarchy and consume it in every component which is located somewhere below it.

How is React's context provided and consumed? Imagine you would have component A as root component that provides the context and component C as one of the child components that consumes the context. Somewhere in between is component D though. The application has a colored theme that can be used to style your components. Your goal is it to make the colored theme available for every component via the React context. In this case, component C should be able to consume it.

First, you have to create the context which gives you access to a Provider and Consumer component. When you create the context with React by using `createContext()`, you can pass it an initial value. In this case, the initial value can be null, because you may have no access to the initial value at this point in time. Otherwise, you can already give it here a proper initial value.

~~~~~~~~
import React from 'react';

const ThemeContext = React.createContext(null);

export default ThemeContext;
~~~~~~~~

Second, the A component would have to provide the context. It is a hardcoded `value` in this case, but it can be anything from component state or component props. The context value may change as well when the local state is changed due to a `setState()` call. Component A displays only component D yet makes the context available to all its other components below it. One of the leaf components will be component C that consumes the context eventually.

{title="Code Playground",lang="javascript"}
~~~~~~~~
import ThemeContext from './ThemeContext';

class A extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <ThemeContext.Provider value={'green'}>
        <D />
      </ThemeContext.Provider>
    ):
  }
}
~~~~~~~~

Third, in your component C, somewhere below component D, you can consume the context object. Notice that component A doesn’t need to pass down anything via component D in the props so that it reaches component C.

{title="Code Playground",lang="javascript"}
~~~~~~~~
import ThemeContext from './ThemeContext';

class C extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <ThemeContext.Consumer>
        {coloredTheme =>
          <div style={{ color: coloredTheme }}>
            Hello World
          </div>
        }
      </ThemeContext.Consumer>
    );
  }
}
~~~~~~~~

The component can derive its style by consuming the context. The Consumer component makes the passed context available by using a {{% a_blank "render prop" "https://reactjs.org/docs/render-props.html" %}}. As you can imagine, following this way every component that needs to be styled accordingly to the colored theme could get the necessary information from React's context API by using the Consumer component now. You only have to use the Provider component which passes the value once somewhere above them and then consume it with the Consumer component. You can read more about [React's context API in the official documentation](https://reactjs.org/docs/context.html).

That’s basically it for React's context API. You have one Provider component that makes properties accessible in React’s context and components that consume the context by using the Consumer component. How does this relate to state management? Basically the pattern, also called provider pattern, is often applied, when using a sophisticated state management solution that makes the state object(s) accessible in your view layer via React's context. Thus the whole state can be accessed in each component. Perhaps you will never implement the provider pattern yourself, but you will most likely use it in a sophisticated state management solution such as Redux or MobX later on. So keep it in mind. Otherwise, React's context can be used to store a state object itself. It can be used when the state is shared globally in your React application, but you don't want to introduce Redux or MobX yet.
