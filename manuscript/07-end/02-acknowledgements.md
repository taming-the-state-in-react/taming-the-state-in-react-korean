## Acknowledgements

Foremost, I want to acknowledge the work of the people who provide us with the solutions to build modern applications nowadays. The true heroes are the people behind the tools we use every day in software development. And these solutions are mostly built in the free time of these people. Just give yourself one minute and think about all the libraries you use in your own applications.

I want to thank [Dan Abramov](https://twitter.com/dan_abramov) and [Andrew Clark](https://twitter.com/acdlite) for open sourcing Redux. A whole community has gathered behind this library and I must admit that it's a great community. In addition, I'd like to thank [Michel Weststrate](https://twitter.com/mweststrate) for providing an alternative. It keeps the whole ecosystem in balance if there is more than one solution. These solutions can learn from each other or provide different approaches to one problem. But it always helps to think out of the box and solve problems from different perspectives.

Again, I want to thank Dan Abramov for guiding a whole generation of JavaScript developers. You work on solutions, such as create-react-app, that make a developer's life easier when getting started in React. You work closely with the community, listening to their pains and provide solutions for those problems. Moreover, you encourage people to contribute in the ecosystem. Each day, there are more contributors for [react](https://github.com/facebook/react), [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) and [redux](https://github.com/reactjs/redux). You give people a platform to share their knowledge. For instance, that's how you encouraged me to write about my experiences working with React and Redux. Without you sharing the content people are writing, often it would never reach a broader audience. You drive people to come up with things that other people could use to solve their problems. The book wouldn't have happened without Dan sharing my content over the last year.

I want to thank [Mark Erikson](https://twitter.com/acemarke) for his perpetual desire to help others in the world of React and Redux. He is the keeper of the great lists ([react-redux-links](https://github.com/markerikson/react-redux-links)) and ([redux-ecosystem-links](https://github.com/markerikson/redux-ecosystem-links)) that you definitely need to check out. There is not a day passing by that I wouldn't see a helpful comment of Mark on Reddit or Twitter about React or Redux. In addition, he is one of the many contributors in open source who shape the libraries to become a great place for newcomers.

I want to thank [Christopher Chedeau](https://twitter.com/Vjeux) for his talk at [React Europe 2016](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRF0OVQL9Nw) about being successful in open source. It had a lasting impact on me and was at the time when I published my first blog post. Thank you for your work with the community.

I want to thank my people at Small Improvements who are great mentors and always a true source of inspiration. They supported me to make the leap educating others about the things I do in my daily work. If you ever wanted to work at a company with a great working culture, you should definitely consider [Small Improvements](https://www.small-improvements.com/). I will always remember a coworker saying: *"It doesn't feel like work. Every day it is like coming to a place to work with friends on a great project."*

I want to thank Per Fragemann, CEO of Small Improvements, for the chance to work, taking responsibilities and grow at Small Improvements. He sees opportunities in people, believes in a sustainable company culture, and gives people all they need to strive. His values taught me a lot.

A special thanks goes to [Charisse Ysabel de Torres](https://dribbble.com/charisseysabel) who contributed the awesome cover for the book in her free time. She was keen to help me with it and in a few brainstorm and several sketching sessions, she came up with an amazing illustration. I couldn't have done it without you. Thank you for being a source of inspiration, a great coworker and friend at Small Improvements.

In the end, I want to thank my girlfriend [Liesa](https://www.iamliesa.com/) for always being supportive. Writing a book can be an enduring battle. There were several weekends, mornings and evenings where I just sat down to write this book. She prevented me from getting into burnout and managed a lot in my life. Now, after the book is written, I hope we can have a few more relaxed weekends again. Liesa is doing most of my marketing efforts. I wouldn't be able to these things on my own as a software engineer. So if you are looking for someone to advertise your stuff, reach out to her!

Last but not least, I want to thank the React community. It's a highly creative and innovative yet friendly place that makes it possible for everyone to build effortless applications. The community is supportive and welcoming to everyone. It provides every newcomer with useful resources to get started. I hope I can contribute to this community as well by writing about these things. One of my objective is to broaden the diversity among developers by providing free learning material to minorities. Reach out to me, if you are from an underrepresented group, to get a free copy of this book.

Thank you.
