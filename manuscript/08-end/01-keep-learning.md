## Never stop Learning

I believe there is one secret when it comes to learning. There exists a principle that is called the Learning Pyramid. When you search for it in your favorite search engine, you will definitely find it. Basically, it shows the relation between retention rates and mental activities. For instance, the average student retention when doing lectures is 5%. That's not a good rate at all. Let's see how all the other mental activities break down according to their retention rates:

* **5% Lecture**
* **10% Reading** (Uuups!)
* **20% Audiovisual** (Phew... I hope you have purchased one of the greater packages to have those supplementary learnings too)
* **30% Demonstration** (Check!)
* **50% Discussion** (Did I mention that there is a [Slack Group](https://slack-the-road-to-learn-react.wieruch.com/)?)
* **75% Practice by Doing** (Hopefully you did all the hands-on parts of this books on your own! If you have purchased the Source Code as well, use these to internalize your learnings.)
* **90% Teach Others** (Join the [Slack Group](https://slack-the-road-to-learn-react.wieruch.com/) to mentor other developers learning about React and its ecosystem!)

Perhaps you recall it from somewhere, but it is always refreshing to see it again. In the beginning of the book, I told you that nobody became perfect by reading a book. You have to apply your learnings. I hope that I arranged the book in a way, enabling you with all the techniques and exercises along the way, that you can learn form these experiences. In addition, I gave you some more learning paths to practice by doing in the last chapter.

Finally, let's get to the one secret about learning that I mentioned. It is the bottom item in the pyramid that has the biggest return of investment: Teaching. Personally, I made the same experience when I started to write about my experiences in web development on my website, answered questions on [Quora](https://www.quora.com/profile/Robin-Wieruch), Reddit and Stack Overflow, and wrote a book(s). You have to dive deep into a topic in order to teach it to others. You learn about the little nuances and you dive deep into these topics because you want to teach them the right way. It's not a shallow learning experience, because you get to know every detail in order to explain it precisely. You will learn tons of stuff that you didn't know before. And most importantly, you will internalize these things by teaching it to others.

After all, you can't know everything. No one is an expert in everything. I challenge myself too, by trying to teach others about web development. I get great feedback from people, positive and negative, that I can apply to grow myself. You can do it as well. You can become better by challenging yourself, teach something to others and grow.

So here is my quest for you after you read this book. I am sure that you have a friend, coworker or perhaps someone you know only online, from Stack Overflow or Reddit, who is keen to learn about the topics taught in this book. Schedule a get-together with this person and teach him/her about it. You can take this book as guidance. After all, teaching others is a win-win situation. Both participants, mentor and student, will grow from it. So my advice for you: Become a mentor, teach others and grow.
